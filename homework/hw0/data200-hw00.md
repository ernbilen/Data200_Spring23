Welcome!üé™ You will turn in your assignment by making changes on this Jupyter Notebook file which is already saved on your Github repository after you accepted my invitation for the assignment. You will work on this file locally. (You can either manually download the files from the online repo, or "clone" it via "Code">"Open with Github Desktop" which downloads a local copy for you, and makes "committing" easier.) Once you finish and you are ready to submit, go to Github and "commit" + "push" to turn in your assignment. Make sure to submit two things: Your completed assignment **as a Markdown file** and the source **.ipynb file**.

I will grade your assignment by opening your "hw0.ipynb" file in Jupyter (in a directory containing all required data files), clicking "Kernel > Restart & Run All", reading the output, and reading your "hw0.md" file. Any code that fails to run due to errors receives a 0, so make sure to "Restart & Run All" your file and verify that all code runs without any issues before you submit.

Please enter your name by double clicking on the cell below, and after yout your name, run it with Shift + Enter.

# Task 1

This assignment is a practice assignment for you to gain practice working with Jupyter Notebook and Github. Go ahead and run the cell below. Make sure it gets executed with no issues. Keep in mind, you can either click on "Cell > Run Cells" at the top, or hit Shift + Enter to run a cell.


```python
print("Hello World!")
```

    Hello World!


Now, go ahead and write python code in the chunk below that prints your favorite movie. Here is my output:

<code>My favorite movie is Big Fish!</code>


```python

```

# Task 2

It is now time to submit the assignment! Make sure that you have saved all your changes on this file by clicking on the little disk üíæ button on the top left. (Wow, a floppy disk! Have you seen one in person?) Make sure to have your final versions for your submission as a .ipynb file and as a .md file. You will turn in both. Now, go to Github Desktop App, or Github.com, (or Git Bash if you would like to run Git commands manually). 

* If you are on the Github Desktop app, you will already see that the app recognized the changes you made on the file, and is asking you to "commit". Do this, and make sure to write a quick comment for what you have changed, (so that you'd remember what you did looking back 10 years from now!) You can write e.g. final update on hw0. After this, hit "push" and your assignment is now submitted! 

* If you are on Github.com, upload your updated .ipynb and md files manually in your repo by hitting "Add File" on top right and selecting/dropping your file. Add a comment for what you have changed, and hit "Commit changes". You are done! This automatically pushes your files at the same time. 

Good work! üèÅ
